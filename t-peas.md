# How to Make the Chickpeas

This is going to be the protein for your meal, you can improvize with any complementary spices that you want, but this is my recommendation. 

The Things You Will Need:

* Chickpeas (2-3 oz. per burrito)
* Large pot
* Salt
* Bay Leaves

1. Place all of the chickpeas into the pot, and fill the pot with 2-3 inches of water.
1. Throw out any peas that float.
1. Salt as desired, and add a few bay leaves.
1. Cover it and bring the water to a boil.
1. Turn down the heat, and let it simmer for about 1 1/2 hours.

You can set this asside for when it is time to assemble your burrito.
