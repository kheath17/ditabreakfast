# How to Make the Bacon

This is the best part! Make sure not to overcook the meat, or the whole breakfast will be ruined.

The Things You Will Need:

* Defrosted Bacon - 4 strips per burrito
* Draining Pan (This is the large square skillet in the drawer under the oven.)


1. Cut each of the bacon strips in half to help them cook more evenly.
1. Place the bacon into the pan for about 4 minutes on medium heat.
1. Flip the slices over and cook them for another 4 minutes.
1. Remove them from the pan and onto a paper towel to cool. 

You can set this aside until it is time to assemble your burrito.
